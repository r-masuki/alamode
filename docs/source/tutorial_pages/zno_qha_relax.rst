ZnO : A QHA-based structural optimization example
---------------------------------------------------

This page explains how to calculate crystal structures at finite temperatures (:math:`T`) based on the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA).

Let's move to the example directory

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cd ${ALAMODE_ROOT}/example/ZnO/qha_relax

.. _tutorial_ZnO_QHA_step1:

1. Prepare force constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial assumes that the harmonic and anharmonic force constants are already calculated up to fourth order. 
Here, please unzip all the XML files in **example/ZnO/qha_relax** and **example/ZnO/qha_relax/strain_IFC** before running the calculation.


.. note::
  We use the harmonic IFCs calculated in the :math:`4\times 4\times 2` supercell 
  and the anharmonic IFCs calculated in the :math:`3\times 3\times 2` supercell
  due to the high computational cost of the DFT calculations for the 
  anharmonic IFCs.
  This treatment is justified because the higher-order IFCs tend to be more localized 
  in real space.

.. _tutorial_ZnO_QHA_step2:

2. Prepare the additional input files.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We need to calculate the elastic constants, the strain-force coupling, and the strain-harmonic-IFC coupling
to calculate the :math:`T`-dependence of the shape of the unit cell.
These input files must be placed in the directory named as the value of ``STRAIN_IFC_DIR``-tag, 
specified in ``&relax``-field in the input file of :red:`anphon`.

* The second-order elastic constants (SOEC) and the third-order elastic constants (TOEC) need to be calculated by yourself.
  The name of the input file must be :red:`elastic_constants.in`.
  The format of :red:`elastic_constants.in` is as follows.
  ::
    SOEC
    V_cell * C_xx,xx
    V_cell * C_xx,xy
    V_cell * C_xx,xz
    ...
    V_cell * C_zz,zz
    TOEC
    V_cell * C_xx,xx,xx
    V_cell * C_xx,xx,xy
    ...
    V_cell * C_zz,zz,zz

  :math:`V_{cell}` is the shape of the unit cell and 
  :math:`C_{\mu_1 \nu_1, \mu_2 \nu_2} = \frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial U}{\partial u_{\mu_1 \nu_1} \partial u_{\mu_2 \nu_2}}`,
  :math:`C_{\mu_1 \nu_1, \mu_2 \nu_2, \mu_3 \nu_3} = \frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial U}{\partial u_{\mu_1 \nu_1} \partial u_{\mu_2 \nu_2} \partial u_{\mu_3 \nu_3}}`
  are the second-order and third-order elastic constants.
  The values in :red:`elastic_constants.in` should be in Rydberg unit.

* The strain-force coupling can be calculated using the `strainIFCcoupling <https://github.com/r-masuki/strainIFCcoupling>`_ code.

  Suppose the strain-force coupling is zero, i.e., the atomic force is zero when we apply finite strain with fixed fractional atomic coordinates. 
  In that case you can set ``RENORM_2TO1ST=0`` and omit the corresponding input file.
  To use ``RENORM_2TO1ST=1``, we need to impose rotational invariance on the IFCs 
  (See Appendix C of the `original paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04537>`_ for the proof), which is not recommended because it usually worsens the fitting error.

  The name of the input file of the strain-force coupling must be :red:`strain_force.in`.

  In this tutorial, the following block of the input file means that  
  if we apply the strain :math:`u_{xx}= 0.005`, the atomic force that acts on the first atom is 
  :math:`(f_x, f_y, f_z) = (0.000000,  -0.034812,  -0.022224)` [Ry/Bohr], e.t.c.
  ::
    xx 0.005 1.0
    0.000000  -0.034812  -0.022224
    0.000000  0.034812  -0.022224
    0.000000  -0.039854  0.022224
    0.000000  0.039854  0.022224

  The meaning of the weight ``1.0`` is similar to that in the next paragraph.

  Note that if we use the `strainIFCcoupling <https://github.com/r-masuki/strainIFCcoupling>`_ code, we can obtain a set of input files that follows this format.

* The strain-harmonic-IFC coupling can be calculated using the `strainIFCcoupling <https://github.com/r-masuki/strainIFCcoupling>`_ code.
  The input files are :red:`strain_harmonic.in` and the related XML files.
  
  For example,
  ::
    xx 0.005 1.0 ZnO442_harmonic_xx_0005.xml

  in :red:`strain_harmonic.in` means that :red:`ZnO442_harmonic_xx_0005.xml` is the XML file of the harmonic IFCs with the strain :math:`u_{xx} = 0.005`. 
  The weight is ``1.0`` in this case because we use the one-sided difference to calculate 

  :math:`\frac{\partial \widetilde{\Phi}_{\mu\mu'}(0\alpha,R'\alpha')}{\partial u_{xx}} \simeq \frac{\widetilde{\Phi}(u_{xx} = 0.005) - \widetilde{\Phi}(u_{\mu \nu} = 0.0)}{0.005}`.
  
  If you use the central difference method 

  :math:`\frac{\partial \widetilde{\Phi}_{\mu\mu'}(0\alpha,R'\alpha')}{\partial u_{xx}} \simeq \frac{\widetilde{\Phi}(u_{xx} = 0.005) - \widetilde{\Phi}(u_{xx} = -0.005)}{0.005\times2}`

  :math:`= 0.5\times \frac{\widetilde{\Phi}(u_{xx} = 0.005) - \widetilde{\Phi}(u_{\mu \nu} = 0.0)}{0.005} + 0.5\times \frac{\widetilde{\Phi}(u_{xx} = -0.005) - \widetilde{\Phi}(u_{\mu \nu} = 0.0)}{-0.005}`,

  the corresponding :red:`strain_harmonic.in` would be like
  ::
    xx 0.005 0.5 ZnO442_harmonic_xx_0005.xml
    xx 0.005 0.5 ZnO442_harmonic_xx_minus_0005.xml

  with respective weights of ``0.5`` (:red:`ZnO442_harmonic_xx_minus_0005.xml` is not provided in this tutorial).

  For the off-diagonal strain,
  :: 
    yz 0.005 1.0 ZnO442_harmonic_yz_00025.xml
  
  means that :red:`ZnO442_harmonic_yz_00025.xml` is the set of harmonic IFCs with :math:`u_{yz} = u_{zy} = 0.005/2 = 0.0025`.

  Note that if you use the `strainIFCcoupling <https://github.com/r-masuki/strainIFCcoupling>`_ code, 
  you can obtain a set of input files that follows this format.

.. _tutorial_ZnO_QHA_step3:

3. Prepare the input file.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input file for the :red:`anphon` calculation is :red:`ZnO_qha_thermo.in`.

.. note::
  
  We set ``KMESH_QHA = 4 4 2`` to save the computational cost.
  In addition, the convergence threshold of the structural optimization (``COORD_CONV_TOL = 1.0e-5`` and ``CELL_CONV_TOL = 1.0e-5``)
  may not be small enough
  if you want to calculate the thermal expansion coefficient :math:`\alpha(T) = \frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}` by
  finite-difference method with a small temperature difference.

  These parameters should be chosen carefully to obtain accurate calculation results.

Run the calculation with 

.. code-block:: bash 

  $ ${ALAMODE_ROOT}/anphon/anphon ZnO_scph_thermo.in > ZnO_scph_thermo.log


.. _tutorial_ZnO_QHA_step4:

4. Analyze the calculation results.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can plot the :math:`T`-dependence of the thermal strain, which is written in :red:`ZnO_qha.umn_tensor`, with 

.. code-block:: bash

  $ gnuplot plot.plt

to obtain the followin figure.

We can see that the thermal expansion is negative at low temperatures, and it turns positive at high temperatures.
The pace of expansion of the :math:`a`-axis is faster than that of the :math:`c`-axis, which agrees with the result in `the paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04537>`_.

.. figure:: ../../img/ZnO_thermal_strain.png
  :scale: 30%
  :align: center

  The temperature-dependence of the thermal strain of ZnO. In this wurtzite case, :math:`u_{xx} = u_{yy} = a(T)/a(T=0)-1.0`, :math:`u_{zz} = c(T)/c(T=0)-1.0`, where :math:`a(T)` and :math:`c(T)` are the :math:`T`-dependent lengths of the :math:`a` and :math:`c`-axis respectively.

The ZSISA (zero static internal stress approximation) and the v-ZSISA (volumetric ZSISA) 
are approximate optimization schemes often used in QHA calculations.
The definition and the accuracy of these methods are discussed in `our original paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04537>`_.

ZSISA and v-ZSISA calculations can be performed by changing ``QHA_SCHEME``-tag in ``&qha``-field.
We can see that ZSISA accurately reproduces the :math:`T`-dependence of the unit cell shape.
v-ZSISA underestimates the anisotropy of the thermal expansion, while it gives a good estimation of the :math:`T`-dependence of the volume of the unit cell, 
which is consistent with the general theorem shown in the paper. 

We can also calculate the :math:`T`-induced change of the electric polarization by 

:math:`P_{\mu}(T) - P_{\mu}(T=0) =\frac{1}{V_{cell}} \sum_{\alpha \nu} Z^*_{\alpha \mu \nu} u^{(0)}_{\alpha \nu}+\sum_{\mu_1 \nu_1}d_{\mu, \mu_1 \nu_1} u_{\mu_1 \nu_1},`

where :math:`Z^*_{\alpha \mu \nu}` are the Born effective charges and :math:`d_{\mu, \mu_1 \nu_1}` are the piezoelectric tensors, which can be calcualted using DFPT in the reference structure. The :math:`T`-dependent atomic displacements :math:`u^{(0)}_{\alpha \nu}` and the strain tensor :math:`u_{\mu_1 \nu_1}` are written in :red:`ZnO_qha.atom_disp` and :red:`ZnO_qha.umn_tensor` respectively.
